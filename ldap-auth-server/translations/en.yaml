      Path to a file containing PEM-encoded root CA certificates to trust when validating the LDAP
      server's TLS certificate. Use this if your LDAP server uses a private CA or self-signed certificate.
      This must be a local path under the /addon_configs/7860403f-ldap-auth-server directory. The addon
      cannot read files from other locations in your Home Assistant host.
